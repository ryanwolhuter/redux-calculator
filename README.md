#Redux Calculator

A calculator that operates by tracking values and operators in the Redux
store. It uses functional "light" style to encapsulate a lot of the ugly
conditional logic a calculator needs to prevent people from using it
wrong.

## Features

React
Redux
Material-UI

## TODO

Implement back button logic.
Add a button to switch between light and dark themes.
